/*
    üß† PROBLEM STATEMENT:

    - You are given a directed graph with 'V' vertices (0 to V-1) represented using an adjacency list.
    - A node is called a **terminal node** if it has no outgoing edges.
    - A node is called a **safe node** if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node.
    - Your task is to return all the **safe nodes** in **ascending order**.

    ‚úÖ Example:
       Input:
       V = 7
       adj = [[1,2], [2,3], [5], [0], [5], [], [4,5]]
       
       Output:
       Safe Nodes: 2 4 5 6

    üí° APPROACH:

    - Step 1: Reverse the graph.
    - Step 2: Track the in-degrees (which were out-degrees in the original graph).
    - Step 3: Use a queue to perform topological sorting (Kahn's Algorithm).
    - Step 4: Nodes which can reach terminal nodes only (i.e., no cycles) are collected.
    - Step 5: Return the sorted list of safe nodes.

    ‚è±Ô∏è TIME COMPLEXITY:  O(V + E) ‚Üí where V = number of vertices, E = number of edges
    üß† SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(V + E) ‚Üí for storing reverse graph and in-degree array
